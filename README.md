#	Question Focused on What I Did	Expected Answer (Business Definition)
1	What is Profit in the context of this project, and how is it derived from the raw data?
2	What does COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) represent for the chocolate products?
3	Why did you need a separate Calendar table, and what problem does it solve for time-based analysis?
4	What is the main distinction between Shipdate and Order_Status in the Shipments table?
5	Why is it important to analyze sales by Category (Bites, Bars, Other) instead of just the overall Total Sales Amount?
6	What is the purpose of the SPID (Salesperson ID) and PID (Product ID) columns in the Shipments table?
7	When analyzing the Salesperson metric, are you looking at their gross sales or their profit margin, and why is that distinction important?
8	What does a "Cancelled" Order_Status indicate, and which department (Sales or Logistics) would care most about tracking this KPI?
9	What simple comparison does the Geographic Map Visual immediately enable for a business user?
10	If a manager wants to know who is the best-performing team, which two columns from the Dimension Data did you link and aggregate to show this?
