# Question Focused on What I Did	Expected Answer
1	What is Profit in the context of this project, and how is it derived from the raw data?

2	What does COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) represent for the chocolate products?

3	Why did you need a separate Calendar table, and what problem does it solve for time-based analysis?

4	What is the main distinction between Shipdate and Order_Status in the Shipments table?

5	Why is it important to analyze sales by Category (Bites, Bars, Other) instead of just the overall Total Sales Amount?

6	What is the purpose of the SPID (Salesperson ID) and PID (Product ID) columns in the Shipments table?

7	When analyzing the Salesperson metric, are you looking at their gross sales or their profit margin, and why is that distinction important?

8	What does a "Cancelled" Order_Status indicate, and which department (Sales or Logistics) would care most about tracking this KPI?

9	What simple comparison does the Geographic Map Visual immediately enable for a business user?

10	If a manager wants to know who is the best-performing team, which two columns from the Dimension Data did you link and aggregate to show this?

# PROCESSES 
What I Really Did:

•	Data Engineering: Used Power Query to clean, shape, and unify three separate data sources (Shipments, Dimensions, Calendar) for analysis.

•	Data Modelling: Engineered a highly efficient Star Schema model, creating clear, robust relationships crucial for accurate cross-table calculations.

•	DAX Expertise: Developed custom DAX measures to calculate critical financial metrics, including Total Profit Margin and COGS, providing true profitability insights.

•	Actionable Insights: Designed an intuitive dashboard visualizing sales trends over time, geographic distribution, and performance-based ranking for salespeople and teams.
This project significantly elevated my proficiency in Power BI, DAX, and Advanced Data Modelling. Excited to leverage these skills in a new BI/Data Analyst role! 

# OUTPUT
The final outcome of the Chocolate Shipments & Sales Performance Dashboard project is a professional-grade, interactive Business Intelligence solution that provides a complete financial and operational overview of the chocolate business.
